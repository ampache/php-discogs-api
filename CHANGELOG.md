# AmpacheDiscogs

## 0.1.0

Export of data functions from the [Ampache Discogs plugin](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/blob/develop/src/Plugin/AmpacheDiscogs.php).

The code will be expanded to make it more usable for other projects but the focus here is on keeping it small and simple.

All data is JSON decoded with objects converted into associative arrays.
